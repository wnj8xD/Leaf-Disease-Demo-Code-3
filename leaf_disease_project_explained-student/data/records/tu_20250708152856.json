The larvae hatch and feed on the fruit.\n\n\n### \ud83d\ude37 Symptoms:\n- \ud83d\ude37  Symptoms include brown spots on the fruit, rotting, and foul odor. These spots widen as the larvae grow and eventually leave the fruit through a small hole.\n\n\n### \ud83d\udc8a Treatment & Prevention:\n- \ud83d\udc8a  Regularly inspect durian trees for signs of the beetle. Remove fallen fruit to prevent infestation. Use pesticides specifically designed for durian pests and apply during larvae season (April to June).
